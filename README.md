# EulerAngleConverter

This is a simple javascript program that converts a 3x3 transformation matrix (assumed input in radians) into Euler angles in degrees. The 3-1-3 or Z-X-Z Euler angle convention is used.

This code is adapted from John Fuller's "spincalc" program located here:

This program does not handle singularities.
